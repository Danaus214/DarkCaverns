UI Notes:

Screen is 80x45
Map is 80x40

Information we want to be always visible along with map:

- Player stats - current and max HP
- Combat stats - current attack and defense vals + modifiers
- Nearby monsters - stats for monsters within 5 squares (not a hp number, just a status bar that gives a sense of damage taken)
	- Maybe color of monster name indicates health? 5 colors indicating rough percentage of HP left.
- Current dungeon level
- Message log - last 5 lines of text
